* Introduction
* The Chenla Institute

A distributed (as MIT MediaLab puts it) anti-disciplinary
research institute incorporated in Singapore, Germany and
France ??? with it's first campus located at Prek Leap
National College of Agriculture in Cambodia.

The Institute's mandate is to develop, document and deploy
the descriptive and proscriptive information, code, designs,
and ideas needed to establish a highly distributed
civilization for Mankind.

The Institute will work with governments, NGOs and industry
to understand and adapt to the radical changes that will
reshape our civilization in the coming decades, and to spin
off commerical and non-profit organizations and companies
that will implement the technologies developed at the
Institute.

The Institute is commited to openess and transparency.  All
works will be released under open source/content/design
licences and made availble as widely as possible.
