Universities, being primarily intellectual in character,
ought to me small and plastic; they should be havens where
scholars, and scientists may regard the world and its
phenomena as their laboratory, without being carried off by
the maelstrom; they should be simple, comforable, quiet
without being monastic or remote; they should be afraid of
no issue; yet they should be under no presure from any side
which might ted to force their scholars to be prejudiced
either for or against any particular solution of the
problems under study; and they should provide the
facilities, the tranquility, and the time requisite to
fundamental inquiry.

— Abraham Flexner
  Confidential Memorandum to the Trustee (September 26,1931)

The suggestions that the Institute for Advanced Study should
be small, that its staff ad students or scholars should be
few, that administration should be iconspiciouse,
inexpensive, subordinate, that members of the teaching
staff, while freed from the waste of time involved in
administrative work, should freely participate in decesions
involving the character, quality, and direction of its
activities, that living conditions should represent a marked
improvement over contemporary academic conditions in
America, that its subjects should be fundamental in
character, ad that it should develop gradually — on these
suggestions there was on both sides of the Atlantic
unanimous agreement.
